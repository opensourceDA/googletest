This directory contains a copy of Google Test for use by users of
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.

This copy contains code specific to VC 6 that we don't intend to
integrate back to the trunk, as we want to keep the code there clean.

This copy is NOT supported by the Google Test team.  If you see a
bug, you are welcome to submit a patch to fix it yourself.  Read
http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/GoogleTestDevGuide for
