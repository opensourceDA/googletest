#summary Google C++ Testing Framework Samples

If you're like us, you'd like to look at some Google Test sample code.  The
[http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/browse/#svn/trunk/samples samples folder] has a number of well-commented samples showing how to use a
variety of Google Test features.

  * [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/browse/trunk/samples/sample1_unittest.cc Sample #1] shows the basic steps of using Google Test to test C++ functions.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/browse/trunk/samples/sample2_unittest.cc Sample #2] shows a more complex unit test for a class with multiple member functions.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/browse/trunk/samples/sample3_unittest.cc Sample #3] uses a test fixture.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/browse/trunk/samples/sample4_unittest.cc Sample #4] puts shared testing logic in a base test fixture, and reuses it in derived fixtures.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/browse/trunk/samples/sample5_unittest.cc Sample #5] teaches how to reuse a test fixture in multiple test cases by deriving sub-fixtures from it.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/browse/trunk/samples/sample6_unittest.cc Sample #6] demonstrates type-parameterized tests.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/browse/trunk/samples/sample7_unittest.cc Sample #7] demonstrates value-parameterized tests.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/browse/trunk/samples/sample8_unittest.cc Sample #8] demonstrates using value-parameterized tests with multiple parameters.
